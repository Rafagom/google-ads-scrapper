# google-ads-scrapper

This bot works with googlesheets integration, you have to create one sheet and activate the googlesheet API

Create a google service account here: https://console.cloud.google.com

Download the key documentation as a .json

Rename it to client_secret.json and add the file to the bot folder

At your google sheets create two tabs with the same names you're using in the spredsheet.py file ("Key Words" and "General")

Make a list of words to search inside key words tab like this:

General tab will looklike this:

Its in portuguese, but you can change the names of each column, a good AD will get "100%" and "sim" grades

In General tab you'll also find the contacts of the AD owner:

So, if you're an Marketing agency you just need to contact those who are making pretty bad choices for their ADs and make some $$ helping them
